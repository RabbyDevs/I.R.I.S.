PRIVACY POLICY
1. Information We Process
I.R.I.S processes the following data:

For Bot Operation:

Server IDs and channel IDs for configuration

Message content (temporarily, for forwarding)

User IDs (for permission checks, not linked to sent messages)

We Do NOT Store:

Content of forwarded messages after delivery

Identities of anonymous message senders

Message metadata beyond operational needs

Any personal information beyond Discord IDs

2. How We Use Information
Message Processing: Messages are temporarily held in memory only for forwarding, then discarded

Configuration Storage: Server settings (channel designations, permissions) are stored to maintain functionality

No Tracking: We do not track which users send specific anonymous messages

3. Data Retention
Forwarded Messages: Not stored; deleted immediately after processing

Configuration Data: Stored until server removes the bot

4. Third-Party Sharing
We do not share any data with third parties. All processing occurs within our infrastructure solely for bot functionality.

5. Security
While we implement reasonable security measures:

Anonymous messages are not encrypted in transit (they follow Discord's security)

We cannot guarantee absolute security of transmitted messages

Discord's privacy and security policies apply to message transmission

6. Your Rights
As a Discord user, you have the right to:

Request removal of the bot from servers you administer

Not use channels where I.R.I.S is active

Report concerns via our support server

7. Children's Privacy
The bot is not intended for users under 13. Discord requires users to be at least 13, and we comply with this requirement.

8. Changes to Privacy Policy
We may update this policy. Continued use after changes constitutes acceptance.
